	description = We need you to give Earth its first artificial satellite! Design, build, and launch a craft that will successfully place an object in orbit with a perigee of at least @/minPeAKM km. You have a time limit, however, and your prestige is riding on the line. If you commit to this, however, your program will receive substantial funding to make the launch possible, and your other sources of income will dry up. Once you go to orbit, you can't go back.&br;&br;You can accept other orbit contracts at the same time as this if want to do multiple things on your first orbital launch (for example, you could combine all four starting orbit contracts and launch a solar-powered polar science satellite.&br;&br;<b><color=red>WHEN YOU COMPLETE THIS CONTRACT, ALL SOUNDING ROCKET CONTRACTS WILL NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE.</color></b> Balance the cost and benefit of when is the best time to complete it.

	synopsis = Launch the first satellite into orbit of Earth
