	description = Commonly called Bennet Radio frequency mass spectrometers, they are only sensitive to charged atoms and molecules since they do not incorporate an ion source. Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique that ionizes chemical species and sorts the ions based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Historically, these simple experiments were flown on many Aerobee sounding rockets and returned to Earth for study.\n\nLevel 1 Mass Spectrometry Experiment. Can gather 25% of Mass Spectrometry Science.
